# Steps for EEG actiCAP Positioning and Prep Before Gel Injection
1. Use the tape measure to measure the circumference around the head through the nasion and inion, but above the ears
2. Choose a cap that is closest to the measured head circumference
3. Help participants place the cap on their head
    - Make sure the cap fits snug, but the participant is comfortable

4. Remove the cap from the participant and place it on the mannequin head once the right size is determined
5. Carefully populate the chosen cap with electrodes
    - done most easily while sitting down with the mannequin head between both legs and splitter box resting on the back with electrodes hanging over both shoulders

6. Clean forehead with sterile alcohol prep wipe
7. Measure the distance between the nasion and the inion over the top of the head
8. Use the red pencil to mark 10% of this distance above the nasion on the forehead
9. Have the participant put on the black cape over their clothes
10. Once all the electrodes have been attached to the cap, place the cap on the participant's head
11. Adjust the cap so that the red pencil mark is visible through the reference electrode
12. Adjust the cap so that the ear openings align with the ears
13. Make sure the cap sits symmetrical
14. Attach the housing clip located on the splitter box to the cape to prevent any movement of the splitter box
15. Turn on the actiCHamp
16. Attach the splitter box to the actiCHamp by clipping the belt to the top
17. Plug the reference electrode into the opening at the front of the actiCHamp labeled 'GND'
18. Once the participant is comfortable, gel injection may begin
